  "body": "# Open Letter Regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\r\n\r\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has passed the Senate, and it must now pass a committee to resolve the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. While many parts of the act warrant serious discussion, we want to address one specific provision in the bill: “Subchapter B of chapter 1 is amended [...] (3) by striking subsection (d) of section 117.” The original subsection (d) of Section 117 allowed universities to grant students tax-free tuition reductions. We, as graduate students, often receive full or partial tuition waivers in exchange for contributing to the teaching and research at the university. The original section ensured that students did not pay taxes on money that they never received, and allowed for an affordable graduate education resulting in a well-educated workforce. However, under the current House version of the new tax plan, any tuition reduction, or money that is not part of our income and that we never see, becomes taxable income. This amendment would increase our taxes by thousands of dollars, making graduate school unaffordable for many of us.\r\n \r\nAt North Carolina State University, a typical PhD student in computer science receives a yearly stipend of around $20,000. In exchange, the student works as a teaching or research assistant, performing work that is vital for the university: teaching classes, holding office hours, proctoring and grading exams, writing papers, applying for patents and conducting research which drives scientific advancement throughout the country. The university directly benefits from this as graduate students work to provide a quality teaching environment and publish cutting-edge research. We believe it is fair to say that graduate students are the backbone of NC State and other universities across the country.\r\n\r\nLet us assume the House provision striking subsection 117(d) remains in the new bill. For the income of $20,000 a student currently pays about $1,000 in federal income tax. However, under the new plan, with the tuition waiver no longer being tax-free, the taxable income of an In-State graduate student would be increased by $11,000, and their taxes would increase to over $2,500. Since tuition for out-of-state students, including international students, is significantly higher, their taxable income would increase by $26,000, resulting in an income tax of almost $5000, a 400% increase from the current tax, and a 25% effective tax rate on their actual income. This tax rate increases to 50% or more for graduate students in schools such as Duke or Carnegie Mellon University where the tuition is higher. While the particulars of the bill, for instance the exact tax rate, are yet to be decided, the end result is the same: Graduate students must pay significantly higher taxes without seeing any increase in income. \r\n\r\nA 2010 NSF study found that universities conducted 51% of all the basic research performed in the United States, with research being done by groups of graduate students conducting experiments lead by faculty, producing trillions of dollars in revenue and thousands of patent filings each year. The expected increase in taxes would lead to a reduction in the number of graduate students capable of affording US universities or even the cost of living in various cities around the nation. This will lead to the inability of schools to attract talented students to perform high-level research, with students considering graduate school and a subsequent careers in other countries. Over time, this will cause the educational mission of the nation to suffer, leaving the nation weaker as a whole. \r\n\r\nGraduate students constitute an integral part of the teaching and research environment at universities. Fewer graduate students would mean a worse learning experience for all students and, over time, reduce the talent attracted to the nation's universities and industries. It is our strong belief that the provision striking section 117(d) of the US tax code must not be accepted in the final tax reform bill by the conference committee. We urge the senators and our elected representatives, as well as all of our fellow constituents who can raise their voices, to ensure that this does not happen.
